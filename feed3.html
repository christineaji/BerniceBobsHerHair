	<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey</b></span> I heard what you said about me to your mother last night.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> Where were you? </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> In the hall. I didn't mean to listen--at first</p>

		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> Where were you? </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> In the hall. I didn't mean to listen--at first. I guess I'd better go
back to Eau Claire--if I'm such a nuisance." Bernice's lower lip was trembling
violently and she continued on a wavering note: "I've tried to be nice, and--and
I've been first neglected and then insulted. No one ever visited me and got such
treatment. But I'm in the way, I see. I'm a drag on you. Your friends don't like
me. Of course I was furious last week when you tried to hint to me that that
dress was unbecoming. Don't you think I know how to dress myself?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span>No</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>What?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> I didn't hint anything, I said, as I remember, that it was
better to wear a becoming dress three times straight than to alternate it
with two frights.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> Do you think that was a very nice thing to say?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span>  I wasn’t trying to be nice. When do you want to go?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>Oh!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> Didn’t you say you were going?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>Yes, but </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span>  Oh, you were only bluffing!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> You're my cousin, I'm v-v-visiting you. I
was to stay a month, and if I go home my mother will know
and she'll wah-wonder----</p>

		Bernice's sobs rose to a flute note, and rising of a sudden she fled from the
room.</p><p>
An hour later, while Marjorie was in the library absorbed in composing one of
those non-committal, marvellously elusive letters that only a young girl can
write, Bernice reappeared, very red-eyed and consciously calm. She cast no
glance at Marjorie but took a book at random from the shelf and sat down as if
to read. Marjorie seemed absorbed in her letter and continued writing. When
the clock showed noon Bernice closed her book with a snap.

		I've decided, that maybe you're right about things--possibly not. But if you'll tell
me why your friends aren't--aren't interested in me I'll see if I can do what you
want me to.
