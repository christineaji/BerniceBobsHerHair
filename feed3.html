		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey</b></span> I heard what you said about me to your mother last night.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> Where were you? </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> In the hall. I didn't mean to listen--at first</p>

		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> Where were you? </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> In the hall. I didn't mean to listen--at first. I guess I'd better go back to Eau Claire--if I'm such a nuisance." Bernice's lower lip was trembling violently and she continued on a wavering note: "I've tried to be nice, and--and I've been first neglected and then insulted. No one ever visited me and got such treatment. But I'm in the way, I see. I'm a drag on you. Your friends don't like me. Of course I was furious last week when you tried to hint to me that that dress was unbecoming. Don't you think I know how to dress myself?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span>No</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>What?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> I didn't hint anything, I said, as I remember, that it was better to wear a becoming dress three times straight than to alternate it with two frights.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> Do you think that was a very nice thing to say?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span>  I wasn’t trying to be nice. When do you want to go?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>Oh!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> Didn’t you say you were going?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>Yes, but </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span>  Oh, you were only bluffing!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> You're my cousin, I'm v-v-visiting you. I was to stay a month, and if I go home my mother will know and she'll wah-wonder----</p>

		<p>Bernice's sobs rose to a flute note, and rising of a sudden she fled from the room.</p>
		<p> An hour later, while Marjorie was in the library absorbed in composing one of
		those non-committal, marvellously elusive letters that only a young girl can
		write, Bernice reappeared, very red-eyed and consciously calm. She cast no
		glance at Marjorie but took a book at random from the shelf and sat down as if
		to read. Marjorie seemed absorbed in her letter and continued writing. When
		the clock showed noon Bernice closed her book with a snap.</p>

		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey</b></span> Oh, my Lord! You little nut! Girls like you are responsible for all the tiresome colorless marriages; all those ghastly inefficiencies that pass as feminine qualities. What a blow it must be when a man with imagination marries the beautiful bundle of clothes that he's been building ideals round, and finds that she's just a weak, whining, cowardly mass of affectations!</p>
		<p>The womanly woman! Her whole early life is occupied in whining criticisms of girls like me who really do have a good time. There's some
		excuse for an ugly girl whining. If I'd been irretrievably ugly I'd never have forgiven my parents for bringing me into the world. But you're starting life without any handicap-- If you expect me to weep with you you'll be disappointed. Go or stay, just as you like. </p>

		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> Do you mean it? Without reservations? Will you do exactly what I say?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> If they’re sensible things.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> They're not! You're no case for sensible things. All right--I'll just give you a few examples now. First, you have no ease of manner. Why? Because you're never sure about your personal appearance. When a girl feels that she's perfectly groomed and dressed she can forget that part of her. That's charm. The more parts of yourself you can afford to forget the more charm you have.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> Don’t I look alirght? </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> No for instance, you never take care of your eyebrows. They're black and lustrous, but by leaving them straggly they're a blemish. They'd be beautiful if you'd take care of them in one-tenth the time you take doing nothing. You're going to brush them so that they'll grow straight.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> But I thought, that you despised little dainty feminine things like that.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> I hate dainty minds, but a girl has to be dainty in person. If she looks like a million dollars she can talk about Russia, ping-pong, or the League of Nations and get away with it. And oh I’m just beginning! Then there’s your dancing.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> Don’t I dance all right?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> No, you don't--you lean on a man; yes, you do--ever so slightly. I noticed it when we were dancing together yesterday. And you dance standing up straight instead of bending over a little. Probably some old lady on the side-line once told you that you looked so dignified that way. But except with a very small girl it's much harder on the man, and he's the one that counts.</p>
		<p>Well, you've got to learn to be nice to men who are sad birds. You look as if you'd been insulted whenever you're thrown with any except the most popular boys. Why, Bernice, I'm cut in on every few feet--and who does most of it? Why, those very sad birds. No girl can afford to neglect them. They're the big part of any crowd. Young boys too shy to talk are the very best conversational practice. Clumsy boys are the best dancing practice. If you can follow them and yet look graceful you can follow a baby tank across a barb-wire skyscraper. </p>
		<p>If you go to a dance and really amuse, say, three sad birds that dance with you; if you talk so well to them that they forget they're stuck with you, you've done something. They'll come back next time, and gradually so many sad birds will dance with you that the attractive boys will see there's no danger of being stuck--then they'll dance with you.</p>
		<p>And finally, poise and charm will just come. You'll wake up some morning knowing you've attained it, and men will know it too.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> You’re a peach to help me, I know you don't like sentiment.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> Oh, I wasn't thinking about that. I was considering whether we hadn't better bob your hair.</p>
