                <p> After dark on Saturday night one could stand on the first tee of the golf-course and see the country-club windows as a yellow expanse over a very black and wavy ocean.

                <p> After dark on Saturday night one could stand on the first tee of the golf-course and see the country-club windows as a yellow expanse over a very black and wavy ocean. The waves of this ocean, so to speak, were the heads of many curious caddies, a few of the more ingenious chauffeurs, the golf professional's deaf sister--and there were usually several stray, diffident waves who might have rolled inside had they so desired. This was the gallery. The balcony was inside. It consisted of the circle of wicker chairs that lined the wall of the combination clubroom and ballroom. At these Saturday-night dances it was largely feminine; a great babel of middle-aged ladies with sharp eyes and icy hearts behind lorgnettes and large bosoms. The main function of the balcony was critical. It occasionally showed grudging admiration, but never approval, for it is well known among ladies over thirty-five that when the younger set dance in the summer-time it is with the very worst intentions in the world, and if they are not bombarded with stony eyes stray couples will dance weird barbaric interludes in the corners, and the more popular, more dangerous, girls will sometimes be kissed in the parked limousines of unsuspecting dowagers. </p>
                <p>But, after all, this critical circle is not close enough to the stage to see the actors' faces and catch the subtler byplay. It can only frown and lean, ask questions and make satisfactory deductions from its set of postulates, such as the one which states that every young man with a large income leads the life of a hunted partridge. It never really appreciates the drama of the shifting, semicruel world of adolescence. No; boxes, orchestra-circle, principals, and chorus are represented by the medley of faces and voices that sway to the plaintive African rhythm of Dyer's dance orchestra.</p>

            <p> From sixteen-year-old Otis Ormonde, who has two more years at Hill School, to G. Reece Stoddard, over whose bureau at home hangs a Harvard law diploma; from little Madeleine Hogue, whose hair still feels strange and uncomfortable on top of her head, to Bessie MacRae, who has been the life of the party a little too long--more than ten years--the medley is not only the centre of the stage but contains the only people capable of getting an un-obstructed view of it.</p>
            <p>With a flourish and a bang the music stops. The couples exchange artificial, effortless smiles, facetiously repeat "lade-da-da dum-dum," and then the clatter of young feminine voices soars over the burst of clapping. A few disappointed stags caught in midfloor as they had been about to cut in subsided listlessly back to the walls, because this was not like the riotous Christmas dances-- these summer hops were considered just pleasantly warm and exciting, where even the younger marrieds rose and performed ancient waltzes and terrifying fox trots to the tolerant amusement of their younger brothers and sisters. </p>

            <p> Warren McIntyre, who casually attended Yale, being one of the unfortunate stags, felt in his dinner-coat pocket for a cigarette and strolled out onto the wide, semidark veranda, where couples were scattered at tables, filling the lanternhung night with vague words and hazy laughter. He nodded here and there at the less absorbed and as he passed each couple some halfforgotten fragment of a story played in his mind, for it was not a large city and every one was Who's Who to every one else's past. There, for example, were Jim Strain and Ethel Demorest, who had been privately engaged for three years. Every one knew that as soon as Jim managed to hold a job for more than two months she would marry him. Yet how bored they both looked, and how wearily Ethel regarded Jim sometimes, as if she wondered why she had trained the vines of her affection on such a wind-shaken poplar.</p>
            <p>Warren was nineteen and rather pitying with those of his friends who hadn't gone East to college. But, like most boys, he bragged tremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from it. There was Genevieve Ormonde, who regularly made the rounds of dances, house-parties, and football games at Princeton, Yale, Williams, and Cornell; there was black-eyed Roberta Dillon, who was quite as famous to her own generation as Hiram Johnson or Ty Cobb; and, of course, there was Marjorie Harvey, who besides having a fairylike face and a dazzling, bewildering tongue was already justly celebrated for having turned five cartwheels in succession during the last pump-and-slipper dance at New Haven.</p>
            <p>Warren, who had grown up across the street from Marjorie, had long been "crazy about her." Sometimes she seemed to reciprocate his feeling with a faint gratitude, but she had tried him by her infallible test and informed him gravely that she did not love him. Her test was that when she was away from him she forgot him and had affairs with other boys. Warren found this discouraging, especially as Marjorie had been making little trips all summer, and for the first two or three days after each arrival home he saw great heaps of mail on the Harveys' hall table addressed to her in various masculine handwritings. To make matters worse, all during the month of August she had been visited by her cousin Bernice from Eau Claire, and it seemed impossible to see her alone. It was always necessary to hunt round and find some one to take care of Bernice. As August waned this was becoming more and more difficult.</p>

            <p> Much as I worshipped Marjorie, I had to admit that Cousin Bernice was sorta dopeless. She was pretty, with red hair and high color, but she was no fun on a party. Every Saturday night I danced a long arduous duty dance with her to please Marjorie, but he had never been anything but bored in her company.</p>

            <p> No matter how beautiful or brilliant a girl may be, the reputation of not being frequently cut in on makes her position at a dance unfortunate. Perhaps boys prefer her company to that of the butterflies with whom they dance a dozen times an evening, but youth in this jazz-nourished generation is temperamentally restless, and the idea of foxtrotting more than one full fox trot with the same girl is distasteful, not to say odious. When it comes to several dances and the intermissions between she can be quite sure that a young man, once relieved, will never tread on her wayward toes again. Warren danced the next full dance with Bernice, and finally, thankful for the intermission, he led her to a table on the veranda. There was a moment's silence while she did unimpressive things with her fan. </p>

		<p> When Marjorie and Bernice reached home at half after midnight they said good
		night at the top of the stairs. Though cousins, they were not intimates. As a
		matter of fact Marjorie had no female intimates--she considered girls stupid.
		Bernice on the contrary all through this parent-arranged visit had rather longed
		to exchange those confidences flavored with giggles and tears that she
		considered an indispensable factor 3 in all feminine intercourse. But in this
		respect she found Marjorie rather cold; felt somehow the same difficulty in
		talking to her that she had in talking to men. Marjorie never giggled, was never
		frightened, seldom embarrassed, and in fact had very few of the qualities which
		Bernice considered appropriately and blessedly feminine.</p>
		<p>As Bernice busied herself with tooth-brush and paste this night she wondered
		for the hundredth time why she never had any attention when she was away
		from home. That her family were the wealthiest in Eau Claire; that her mother
		entertained tremendously, gave little dinners for her daughter before all dances
		and bought her a car of her own to drive round in, never occurred to her as
		factors in her home-town social success. Like most girls she had been brought
		up on the warm milk prepared by Annie Fellows Johnston and on
		novels in which the female was beloved because of certain mysterious womanly
		qualities. always mentioned but never displayed.</p>
		<p>Bernice felt a vague pain that she was not at presentengaged in being popular.
		She did not know that had it not been for Marjorie's campaigning she would
		have danced the entire evening with one man; but she knew that even in Eau
		Claire other girls with less position and less pulchritude were given a much
		bigger rush. She attributed this to something subtly unscrupulous in those girls.
		It had never worried her, and if it had her mother would have assured her that
		the other girls cheapened themselves and that men really respected girls like
		Bernice.</p>
		<p>She turned out the light in her bathroom, and on an impulse decided to go in
		and chat for a moment with her aunt Josephine, whose light was still on. Her
		soft slippers bore her noiselessly down the carpeted hall, but hearing voices
		inside she stopped near the partly opened door. Then she caught
		her own name, and without any definite intention of eavesdropping lingered--
		and the thread of the conversation going on inside pierced her consciousness
		sharply as if it had been drawn through with a needle.</p>

		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span> What’s a little cheap popularity</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span>  It's everything when you're eighteen, I've done my best. I've been polite and I've made men dance with her, but they just won't stand being bored. When I think of that gorgeous coloring wasted on
		such a ninny, and think what Martha Carey could do with it--oh!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span> There’s no courtesy these days</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> Well, no girl can permanently bolster up a lame-duck visitor, because these days it's every girl for herself. I've even tried to drop her hints about clothes and things, and she's been furious--given
		me the funniest looks. She's sensitive enough to know she's not getting
		away with much, but I'll bet she consoles herself by thinking that she's
		very virtuous and that I'm too gay and fickle and will come to a bad end.
		All unpopular girls think that way. Sour grapes! Sarah Hopkins refers to
		Genevieve and Roberta and me as gardenia girls! I'll bet she'd give ten
		years of her life and her European education to be a gardenia girl and
		have three orfour men in love with her and be cut in on every few feet at
		dances.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey </b></span> It seems to me, that you ought to be able to do something for Bernice. I know she's not very vivacious.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> Vivacious! Good grief! I've never heard her say anything to a boy except that it's hot or the floor's crowded or that she's going to school in New York next year. Sometimes she asks them what kind of car
		they have and tells them the kind she has. Thrilling!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey </b></span> All I know is that other girls not half so sweet and attractive get partners. Martha Carey, for instance, is stout and loud, and her mother is distinctly common. Roberta Dillon is so thin this year that she looks as though Arizona were the place for her. She's dancing herself to death.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> But, mother, Martha is cheerful and awfully witty and an awfully slick girl, and Roberta's a marvellous dancer. She's been popular for ages! I think it's that crazy Indian blood in Bernice. Maybe she's a reversion to type. Indian women all just sat round and never said
		anything.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span>Go to bed, you silly child, I wouldn't have told you that if I'd thought you were going to remember it. And I think most of your ideas are perfectly idiotic.</p>

Bernice's lower lip was trembling violently and she continued on a wavering note: "I've tried to be nice, and--and I've been first neglected and then insulted. No one ever visited me and got such treatment. But I'm in the way, I see. I'm a drag on you. Your friends don't like me. Of course I was furious last week when you tried to hint to me that that dress was unbecoming. Don't you think I know how to dress myself?</p>

		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>What?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> I didn't hint anything, I said, as I remember, that it was better to wear a becoming dress three times straight than to alternate it with two frights.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> Do you think that was a very nice thing to say?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span>  I wasn’t trying to be nice. When do you want to go?</p>

		<p>Bernice's sobs rose to a flute note, and rising of a sudden she fled from the room.</p>
		<p> An hour later, while Marjorie was in the library absorbed in composing one of
		those non-committal, marvellously elusive letters that only a young girl can
		write, Bernice reappeared, very red-eyed and consciously calm. She cast no
		glance at Marjorie but took a book at random from the shelf and sat down as if
		to read. Marjorie seemed absorbed in her letter and continued writing. When
		the clock showed noon Bernice closed her book with a snap.</p>

		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> Do you mean it? Without reservations? Will you do exactly what I say?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> If they’re sensible things.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> They're not! You're no case for sensible things. All right--I'll just give you a few examples now. First, you have no ease of manner. Why? Because you're never sure about your personal appearance. When a girl feels that she's perfectly groomed and dressed she can forget that part of her. That's charm. The more parts of yourself you can afford to forget the more charm you have.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> Don’t I look alirght? </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> No for instance, you never take care of your eyebrows. They're black and lustrous, but by leaving them straggly they're a blemish. They'd be beautiful if you'd take care of them in one-tenth the time you take doing nothing. You're going to brush them so that they'll grow straight.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> But I thought, that you despised little dainty feminine things like that.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> I hate dainty minds, but a girl has to be dainty in person. If she looks like a million dollars she can talk about Russia, ping-pong, or the League of Nations and get away with it. And oh I’m just beginning! Then there’s your dancing.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> Don’t I dance all right?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span> No, you don't--you lean on a man; yes, you do--ever so slightly. I noticed it when we were dancing together yesterday. And you dance standing up straight instead of bending over a little. Probably some old lady on the side-line once told you that you looked so dignified that way. But except with a very small girl it's much harder on the man, and he's the one that counts.</p>
		<p>Well, you've got to learn to be nice to men who are sad birds. You look as if you'd been insulted whenever you're thrown with any except the most popular boys. Why, Bernice, I'm cut in on every few feet--and who does most of it? Why, those very sad birds. No girl can afford to neglect them. They're the big part of any crowd. Young boys too shy to talk are the very best conversational practice. Clumsy boys are the best dancing practice. If you can follow them and yet look graceful you can follow a baby tank across a barb-wire skyscraper. </p>
		<p>If you go to a dance and really amuse, say, three sad birds that dance with you; if you talk so well to them that they forget they're stuck with you, you've done something. They'll come back next time, and gradually so many sad birds will dance with you that the attractive boys will see there's no danger of being stuck--then they'll dance with you.</p>
		<p>And finally, poise and charm will just come. You'll wake up some morning knowing you've attained it, and men will know it too.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> You’re a peach to help me, I know you don't like sentiment.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> Oh, I wasn't thinking about that. I was considering whether we hadn't better bob your hair.</p>

		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> Because I'm considering it. It's such a sure and easy way of attracting attention. I want to be a society vampire, you see.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> So I've decided, that early next week I'm going down to the Sevier Hotel barber-shop, sit in the first chair, and get my hair bobbed. Of course I'm charging admission, but if you'll all come down and encourage me I'll issue passes for the inside seats.</p>

		<p><span><b>G. Reece Stoddard </b></span> I’ll take a box right now. Do you believe in bobbed hair?</p>

		<p>Two hours later, while Warren McIntyre was standing passively in the stag line
		abstractedly watching the dancers and wondering whither and with whom
		Marjorie had disappeared, an unrelated perception began to creep slowly
		upon him--a perception that Bernice, cousin to Marjorie, had been cut in on
		several times in the past five minutes. He closed his eyes, opened them and
		looked again. Several minutes back she had been dancing with a visiting boy, a
		matter easily accounted for; a visiting boy would know no better. But now she
		was dancing with some one else, and there was Charley Paulson headed for
		her with enthusiastic determination in his eye. Funny--Charley seldom danced
		with more than three girls an evening.</p>
		<p>Warren was distinctly surprised when--the exchange having been effected--the
		man relieved proved to be none other than G. Reece Stoddard himself. And G.
		Reece seemed not at all jubilant at being relieved. Next time Bernice danced
		near, Warren regarded her intently. Yes, she was pretty, distinctly pretty; and tonight
		her face seemed really vivacious. She had that look that no woman,
		however histrionically proficient, can successfully counterfeit--she looked as if
		she were having a good time. He liked the way she had her hair arranged,
		wondered if it was brilliantine that made it glisten so. And that dress was
		becoming--a dark red that set off her shadowy eyes and high coloring. He
		remembered that he had thought her pretty when she first came to town, before
		he had realized that she was dull. Too bad she was dull--dull girls unbearable--
		certainly pretty though.</p>
		<p>His thoughts zigzagged back to Marjorie. This disappearance would be like
		other disappearances. When she reappeared he would demand where she had
		been--would be told emphatically that it was none of his business. What a pity
		she was so sure of him! She basked in the knowledge that no other girl in town
		interested him; she defied him to fall in love with Genevieve or Roberta. Warren
		sighed. The way to Marjorie's affections was a labyrinth indeed. He looked up.
		Bernice was again dancing with the visiting boy. Half unconsciously he took a
		step out from the stag line in her direction, and hesitated. Then he said to
		himself that it was charity. He walked toward her --collided suddenly with G.
		Reece Stoddard.

		<p>But perhaps the most significant symbol of her success was the gray car of the
		hypercritical Warren McIntyre, parked daily in front of the Harvey house. At first
		the parlor-maid was distinctly startled when he asked for Bernice instead of
		Marjorie; after a week of it she told the cook that Miss Bernice had gotta hold a
		Miss Marjorie's best fella.</p>
		<p>And Miss Bernice had. Perhaps it began with Warren's desire to rouse jealousy
		in Marjorie; perhaps it was the familiar though unrecognized strain of Marjorie in
		Bernice's conversation; perhaps it was both of these and something of sincere
		attraction besides. But somehow the collective mind of the younger set knew
		within a week that Marjorie's most reliable beau had made an amazing faceabout
		and was giving an indisputable rush to Marjorie's guest. The question
		of the moment was how Marjorie would take it. Warren called Bernice on the
		'phone twice a day, sent her notes, and theywere frequently seen together in his
		roadster, obviously engrossed in one of those tense, significant conversations
		as to whether or not he was sincere.</p>
		<p>Marjorie on being twitted only laughed. She said she was mighty glad that
		Warren had at last found some one who appreciated him. So the younger set
		laughed, too, and guessed that Marjorie didn't care and let it go at that. One
		afternoon when there were only three days left of her visit Bernice was waiting
		in the hall for Warren, with whom she was going to a bridge party. She was in
		rather a blissful mood, and when Marjorie--also bound for the party-- appeared
		beside her and began casually to adjust her hat in the mirror, Bernice was
		utterly unprepared for anything in the nature of a clash. Marjorie did her work
		very coldly and succinctly in three sentences.</p>

		<p>Refusing further preliminaries, Bernice took her seat on high. A man in the chair
		next to her turned on his side and gave her a glance, half lather, half
		amazement. One barber started and spoiled little Willy Schuneman's monthly
		haircut. Mr. O'Reilly in the last chair grunted and swore musically in ancient

		<p>But Bernice saw nothing, heard nothing. Her only living sense told her that this
			man in the white coat had removed one tortoise-shell comb and then another;
			that his fingers were fumbling clumsily with unfamiliar hairpins; that this hair, this
			wonderful hair of hers, was going--she would never again feel its long
			voluptuous pull as it hung in a dark-brown glory down her back. For a second
			she was near breaking down, and then the picture before her swam
			mechanically into her vision--Marjorie's mouth curling in a faint ironic smile as if
			to say: "Give up and get down! You tried to buck me and I called
			your bluff. You see you haven't got a prayer." And some last energy rose up in
			Bernice, for she clinched her hands under the white cloth, and there was a
			curious narrowing of her eyes that Marjorie remarked on to some one long
			afterward.</p>
			<p>Twenty minutes later the barber swung her round to face the mirror, and she
			flinched at the full extent of the damage that had been wrought. Her hair was
			not curly, and now it lay in lank lifeless blocks on both sides of her suddenly
			pale face. It was ugly as sin--she had known it would be ugly as sin. Her
			face's chief charm had been a Madonna-like simplicity. Now that was gone and
			she was--well, frightfully mediocre--not stagy; only ridiculous, like a Greenwich
			Villager who had left her spectacles at home. As she climbed down from the
			chair she tried to smile--failed miserably. She saw two of the girls exchange
			glances; noticed Marjorie's mouth curved in attenuated mockery--and that
			Warren's eyes were suddenly very cold.</p>

		<p>But as the door closed something snapped within Bernice. She sprang
		dynamically to her feet, clinching her hands, then swiftly and noiselessly
		crossed over to her bed and from underneath it dragged out her suitcase. Into it
		she tossed toilet articles and a change of clothing. Then she turned to her trunk
		and quickly dumped in two drawerfuls of lingerie and summer dresses. She
		moved quietly, but with deadly efficiency, and in three-quarters of an hour her
		trunk was locked and strapped and she was fully dressed in a becoming new
		travelling suit that Marjorie had helped her pick out.
		Sitting down at her desk she wrote a short note to Mrs.Harvey, in which she
		briefly outlined her reasons for going. She sealed it, addressed it, and laid it on
		her pillow. She glanced at her watch. The train left at one, and she knew that
		if she walked down to the Marborough Hotel two blocks away she could easily
		get a taxicab. Suddenly she drew in her breath sharply and an expression
		flashed into her eyes that a practised character reader might have connected
		vaguely with the set look she had worn in the barber's chair-- somehow a
		development of it. It was quite a new look for Bernice and it carried
		consequences.</p>
		<p>She went stealthily to the bureau, picked up an article that lay there, and turning
		out all the lights stood quietly until her eyes became accustomed to the
		darkness. Softly she pushed open the door to Marjorie's room. She heard the
		quiet, even breathing of an untroubled conscience asleep. She was by the
		bedside now, very deliberate and calm. She acted swiftly. Bending over she
		found one of the braids of Marjorie's hair, followed it up with her hand to the
		point nearest the head, and then holding it a little slack so that the sleeper
		would feel no pull, she reached down with the shears and severed it. With the
		pigtail in her hand she held her breath. Marjorie had muttered something in her
		sleep. Bernice deftly amputated the other braid, paused for an instant, and then
		flitted swiftly and silently back to her own room.</p>
		<p>Down-stairs she opened the big front door, closed it carefully behind her, and
		feeling oddly happy and exuberant stepped off the porch into the moonlight,
		swinging her heavy grip like a shopping-bag. After a minute's brisk walk she
		discovered that her left hand still held the two blond braids. She laughed
		unexpectedly--had to shut her mouth hard to keep from emitting an absolute
		peal. She was passing Warren's house now, and on the impulse she set down
		her baggage, and swinging the braids like pieces of rope flung them at the
		wooden porch, where they landed with a slight thud. She laughed again, no
		longer restraining herself. "Huh!" she giggled wildly. "Scalp the selfish thing!"
		Then picking up her suitcase she set off at a half-run down the moonlit street.</p>
