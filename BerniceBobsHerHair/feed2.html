		<p> When Marjorie and Bernice reached home at half after midnight they said good
		night at the top of the stairs. Though cousins, they were not intimates. As a
		matter of fact Marjorie had no female intimates--she considered girls stupid.
		Bernice on the contrary all through this parent-arranged visit had rather longed
		to exchange those confidences flavored with giggles and tears that she
		considered an indispensable factor 3 in all feminine intercourse. But in this
		respect she found Marjorie rather cold; felt somehow the same difficulty in
		talking to her that she had in talking to men. Marjorie never giggled, was never
		frightened, seldom embarrassed, and in fact had very few of the qualities which
		Bernice considered appropriately and blessedly feminine.</p>
		<p>As Bernice busied herself with tooth-brush and paste this night she wondered
		for the hundredth time why she never had any attention when she was away
		from home. That her family were the wealthiest in Eau Claire; that her mother
		entertained tremendously, gave little dinners for her daughter before all dances
		and bought her a car of her own to drive round in, never occurred to her as
		factors in her home-town social success. Like most girls she had been brought
		up on the warm milk prepared by Annie Fellows Johnston and on
		novels in which the female was beloved because of certain mysterious womanly
		qualities. always mentioned but never displayed.</p>
		<p>Bernice felt a vague pain that she was not at presentengaged in being popular.
		She did not know that had it not been for Marjorie's campaigning she would
		have danced the entire evening with one man; but she knew that even in Eau
		Claire other girls with less position and less pulchritude were given a much
		bigger rush. She attributed this to something subtly unscrupulous in those girls.
		It had never worried her, and if it had her mother would have assured her that
		the other girls cheapened themselves and that men really respected girls like
		Bernice.</p>
		<p>She turned out the light in her bathroom, and on an impulse decided to go in
		and chat for a moment with her aunt Josephine, whose light was still on. Her
		soft slippers bore her noiselessly down the carpeted hall, but hearing voices
		inside she stopped near the partly opened door. Then she caught
		her own name, and without any definite intention of eavesdropping lingered--
		and the thread of the conversation going on inside pierced her consciousness
		sharply as if it had been drawn through with a needle.</p>

		<p> She's absolutely hopeless! Oh, I know what you're going to say! So many
		people have told you how pretty and sweet she is, and how she can cook!
		What of it? She has a bum time. Men don't like her.

		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span> What’s a little cheap popularity</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey</b></span>  It's everything when you're eighteen, I've done my best. I've been polite and I've made men dance with her, but they just won't stand being bored. When I think of that gorgeous coloring wasted on
		such a ninny, and think what Martha Carey could do with it--oh!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span> There’s no courtesy these days</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> Well, no girl can permanently bolster up a lame-duck visitor, because these days it's every girl for herself. I've even tried to drop her hints about clothes and things, and she's been furious--given
		me the funniest looks. She's sensitive enough to know she's not getting
		away with much, but I'll bet she consoles herself by thinking that she's
		very virtuous and that I'm too gay and fickle and will come to a bad end.
		All unpopular girls think that way. Sour grapes! Sarah Hopkins refers to
		Genevieve and Roberta and me as gardenia girls! I'll bet she'd give ten
		years of her life and her European education to be a gardenia girl and
		have three orfour men in love with her and be cut in on every few feet at
		dances.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey </b></span> It seems to me, that you ought to be able to do something for Bernice. I know she's not very vivacious.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> Vivacious! Good grief! I've never heard her say anything to a boy except that it's hot or the floor's crowded or that she's going to school in New York next year. Sometimes she asks them what kind of car
		they have and tells them the kind she has. Thrilling!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey </b></span> All I know is that other girls not half so sweet and attractive get partners. Martha Carey, for instance, is stout and loud, and her mother is distinctly common. Roberta Dillon is so thin this year that she looks as though Arizona were the place for her. She's dancing herself to death.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Marjorie Harvey </b></span> But, mother, Martha is cheerful and awfully witty and an awfully slick girl, and Roberta's a marvellous dancer. She's been popular for ages! I think it's that crazy Indian blood in Bernice. Maybe she's a reversion to type. Indian women all just sat round and never said
		anything.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span>Go to bed, you silly child, I wouldn't have told you that if I'd thought you were going to remember it. And I think most of your ideas are perfectly idiotic.</p>
