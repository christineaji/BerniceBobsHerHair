		<p>But perhaps the most significant symbol of her success was the gray car of the
		hypercritical Warren McIntyre, parked daily in front of the Harvey house. At first
		the parlor-maid was distinctly startled when he asked for Bernice instead of
		Marjorie; after a week of it she told the cook that Miss Bernice had gotta hold a
		Miss Marjorie's best fella.</p>
		<p>And Miss Bernice had. Perhaps it began with Warren's desire to rouse jealousy
		in Marjorie; perhaps it was the familiar though unrecognized strain of Marjorie in
		Bernice's conversation; perhaps it was both of these and something of sincere
		attraction besides. But somehow the collective mind of the younger set knew
		within a week that Marjorie's most reliable beau had made an amazing faceabout
		and was giving an indisputable rush to Marjorie's guest. The question
		of the moment was how Marjorie would take it. Warren called Bernice on the
		'phone twice a day, sent her notes, and theywere frequently seen together in his
		roadster, obviously engrossed in one of those tense, significant conversations
		as to whether or not he was sincere.</p>
		<p>Marjorie on being twitted only laughed. She said she was mighty glad that
		Warren had at last found some one who appreciated him. So the younger set
		laughed, too, and guessed that Marjorie didn't care and let it go at that. One
		afternoon when there were only three days left of her visit Bernice was waiting
		in the hall for Warren, with whom she was going to a bridge party. She was in
		rather a blissful mood, and when Marjorie--also bound for the party-- appeared
		beside her and began casually to adjust her hat in the mirror, Bernice was
		utterly unprepared for anything in the nature of a clash. Marjorie did her work
		very coldly and succinctly in three sentences.</p>

		<p>Two hours later, while Warren McIntyre was standing passively in the stag line
		abstractedly watching the dancers and wondering whither and with whom
		Marjorie had disappeared, an unrelated perception began to creep slowly
		upon him--a perception that Bernice, cousin to Marjorie, had been cut in on
		several times in the past five minutes. He closed his eyes, opened them and
		looked again. Several minutes back she had been dancing with a visiting boy, a
		matter easily accounted for; a visiting boy would know no better. But now she
		was dancing with some one else, and there was Charley Paulson headed for
		her with enthusiastic determination in his eye. Funny--Charley seldom danced
		with more than three girls an evening.</p>
		<p>Warren was distinctly surprised when--the exchange having been effected--the
		man relieved proved to be none other than G. Reece Stoddard himself. And G.
		Reece seemed not at all jubilant at being relieved. Next time Bernice danced
		near, Warren regarded her intently. Yes, she was pretty, distinctly pretty; and tonight
		her face seemed really vivacious. She had that look that no woman,
		however histrionically proficient, can successfully counterfeit--she looked as if
		she were having a good time. He liked the way she had her hair arranged,
		wondered if it was brilliantine that made it glisten so. And that dress was
		becoming--a dark red that set off her shadowy eyes and high coloring. He
		remembered that he had thought her pretty when she first came to town, before
		he had realized that she was dull. Too bad she was dull--dull girls unbearable--
		certainly pretty though.</p>
		<p>His thoughts zigzagged back to Marjorie. This disappearance would be like
		other disappearances. When she reappeared he would demand where she had
		been--would be told emphatically that it was none of his business. What a pity
		she was so sure of him! She basked in the knowledge that no other girl in town
		interested him; she defied him to fall in love with Genevieve or Roberta. Warren
		sighed. The way to Marjorie's affections was a labyrinth indeed. He looked up.
		Bernice was again dancing with the visiting boy. Half unconsciously he took a
		step out from the stag line in her direction, and hesitated. Then he said to
		himself that it was charity. He walked toward her --collided suddenly with G.
		Reece Stoddard.</p>

		<p>Refusing further preliminaries, Bernice took her seat on high. A man in the chair
		next to her turned on his side and gave her a glance, half lather, half
		amazement. One barber started and spoiled little Willy Schuneman's monthly
		haircut. Mr. O'Reilly in the last chair grunted and swore musically in ancient
		Gaelic as a razor bit into his cheek. Two bootblacks became wide-eyed and
		rushed for her feet. No, Bernice didn't care for a shine.
		Outside a passer-by stopped and stared; a couple joined him; half a dozen
		small boys' noses sprang into life, flattened against the glass; and snatches of
		conversation borne on the summer breeze drifted in through the screen-door.</p>

		<p>But Bernice saw nothing, heard nothing. Her only living sense told her that this
			man in the white coat had removed one tortoise-shell comb and then another;
			that his fingers were fumbling clumsily with unfamiliar hairpins; that this hair, this
			wonderful hair of hers, was going--she would never again feel its long
			voluptuous pull as it hung in a dark-brown glory down her back. For a second
			she was near breaking down, and then the picture before her swam
			mechanically into her vision--Marjorie's mouth curling in a faint ironic smile as if
			to say: "Give up and get down! You tried to buck me and I called
			your bluff. You see you haven't got a prayer." And some last energy rose up in
			Bernice, for she clinched her hands under the white cloth, and there was a
			curious narrowing of her eyes that Marjorie remarked on to some one long
			afterward.</p>
			<p>Twenty minutes later the barber swung her round to face the mirror, and she
			flinched at the full extent of the damage that had been wrought. Her hair was
			not curly, and now it lay in lank lifeless blocks on both sides of her suddenly
			pale face. It was ugly as sin--she had known it would be ugly as sin. Her
			face's chief charm had been a Madonna-like simplicity. Now that was gone and
			she was--well, frightfully mediocre--not stagy; only ridiculous, like a Greenwich
			Villager who had left her spectacles at home. As she climbed down from the
			chair she tried to smile--failed miserably. She saw two of the girls exchange
			glances; noticed Marjorie's mouth curved in attenuated mockery--and that
			Warren's eyes were suddenly very cold.</p>
