		When Marjorie and Bernice reached home at half after midnight they said good
night at the top of the stairs. Though cousins, they were not intimates. As a
matter of fact Marjorie had no female intimates--she considered girls stupid.
Bernice on the contrary all through this parent-arranged visit had rather longed
to exchange those confidences flavored with giggles and tears that she
considered an indispensable factor 3 in all feminine intercourse. But in this
respect she found Marjorie rather cold; felt somehow the same difficulty in
talking to her that she had in talking to men. Marjorie never giggled, was never
frightened, seldom embarrassed, and in fact had very few of the qualities which
Bernice considered appropriately and blessedly feminine.
As Bernice busied herself with tooth-brush and paste this night she wondered
for the hundredth time why she never had any attention when she was away
from home. That her family were the wealthiest in Eau Claire; that her mother
entertained tremendously, gave little dinners for her daughter before all dances
and bought her a car of her own to drive round in, never occurred to her as
factors in her home-town social success. Like most girls she had been brought
up on the warm milk prepared by Annie Fellows Johnston and on
novels in which the female was beloved because of certain mysterious womanly
qualities. always mentioned but never displayed.
Bernice felt a vague pain that she was not at presentengaged in being popular.
She did not know that had it not been for Marjorie's campaigning she would
have danced the entire evening with one man; but she knew that even in Eau
Claire other girls with less position and less pulchritude were given a much
bigger rush. She attributed this to something subtly unscrupulous in those girls.
It had never worried her, and if it had her mother would have assured her that
the other girls cheapened themselves and that men really respected girls like
Bernice.
She turned out the light in her bathroom, and on an impulse decided to go in
and chat for a moment with her aunt Josephine, whose light was still on. Her
soft slippers bore her noiselessly down the carpeted hall, but hearing voices
inside she stopped near the partly opened door. Then she caught
her own name, and without any definite intention of eavesdropping lingered--
and the thread of the conversation going on inside pierced her consciousness
sharply as if it had been drawn through with a needle.

		She's absolutely hopeless! Oh, I know what you're going to say! So many
people have told you how pretty and sweet she is, and how she can cook!
What of it? She has a bum time. Men don't like her

	<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span> What’s a little cheap popularity</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey</b50></span>  It's everything when you're eighteen, I've done my best.
I've been polite and I've made men dance with her, but they just won't
stand being bored. When I think of that gorgeous coloring wasted on
such a ninny, and think what Martha Carey could do with it--oh!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span> There’s no courtesy these days</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> Well, no girl can permanently bolster up a lame-duck
visitor, because these days it's every girl for herself. I've even tried to
drop her hints about clothes and things, and she's been furious--given
me the funniest looks. She's sensitive enough to know she's not getting
away with much, but I'll bet she consoles herself by thinking that she's
very virtuous and that I'm too gay and fickle and will come to a bad end.
All unpopular girls think that way. Sour grapes! Sarah Hopkins refers to
Genevieve and Roberta and me as gardenia girls! I'll bet she'd give ten
years of her life and her European education to be a gardenia girl and
have three orfour men in love with her and be cut in on every few feet at
dances.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey </b></span> It seems to me, that you ought to be able to do
something for Bernice. I know she's not very vivacious.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> Vivacious! Good grief! I've never heard her say anything
to a boy except that it's hot or the floor's crowded or that she's going to
school in New York next year. Sometimes she asks them what kind of car
they have and tells them the kind she has. Thrilling!</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey </b></span> All I know is that other girls not half so sweet and
attractive get partners. Martha Carey, for instance, is stout and loud, and her
mother is distinctly common. Roberta Dillon is so thin this year that she looks
as though Arizona were the place for her. She's dancing herself to death.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Majorie Harvey </b></span> But, mother, Martha is cheerful and awfully witty and an
awfully slick girl, and Roberta's a marvellous dancer. She's been popular
for ages! I think it's that crazy Indian blood in Bernice. Maybe she's a
reversion to type. Indian women all just sat round and never said
anything.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Mrs. Josephine Harvey</b></span>Go to bed, you silly child, I wouldn't have told you
that if I'd thought you were going to remember it. And I think most of your ideas
are perfectly idiotic.</p>
