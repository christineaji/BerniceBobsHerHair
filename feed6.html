		<p>Bernice did not fully realize the outrageous trap that had been set for her until she met her aunt's amazed glance just before dinner.</p>

		<p><span><b>Mrs Josephine Harvey</b></span> Why, child, in her paper on `The Foibles of the Younger Generation' that she read at the last meeting of the Thursday Club she devoted fifteen minutes to bobbed hair. It's her pet abomination. And the dance is for you and Marjorie! Oh, Bernice, what'll your mother say? She'll think I let you do it.</pp>

		<p>But as the door closed something snapped within Bernice. She sprang
		dynamically to her feet, clinching her hands, then swiftly and noiselessly
		crossed over to her bed and from underneath it dragged out her suitcase. Into it
		she tossed toilet articles and a change of clothing. Then she turned to her trunk
		and quickly dumped in two drawerfuls of lingerie and summer dresses. She
		moved quietly, but with deadly efficiency, and in three-quarters of an hour her
		trunk was locked and strapped and she was fully dressed in a becoming new
		travelling suit that Marjorie had helped her pick out.
		Sitting down at her desk she wrote a short note to Mrs.Harvey, in which she
		briefly outlined her reasons for going. She sealed it, addressed it, and laid it on
		her pillow. She glanced at her watch. The train left at one, and she knew that
		if she walked down to the Marborough Hotel two blocks away she could easily
		get a taxicab. Suddenly she drew in her breath sharply and an expression
		flashed into her eyes that a practised character reader might have connected
		vaguely with the set look she had worn in the barber's chair-- somehow a
		development of it. It was quite a new look for Bernice and it carried
		consequences.</p>
		<p>She went stealthily to the bureau, picked up an article that lay there, and turning
		out all the lights stood quietly until her eyes became accustomed to the
		darkness. Softly she pushed open the door to Marjorie's room. She heard the
		quiet, even breathing of an untroubled conscience asleep. She was by the
		bedside now, very deliberate and calm. She acted swiftly. Bending over she
		found one of the braids of Marjorie's hair, followed it up with her hand to the
		point nearest the head, and then holding it a little slack so that the sleeper
		would feel no pull, she reached down with the shears and severed it. With the
		pigtail in her hand she held her breath. Marjorie had muttered something in her
		sleep. Bernice deftly amputated the other braid, paused for an instant, and then
		flitted swiftly and silently back to her own room.</p>
		<p>Down-stairs she opened the big front door, closed it carefully behind her, and
		feeling oddly happy and exuberant stepped off the porch into the moonlight,
		swinging her heavy grip like a shopping-bag. After a minute's brisk walk she
		discovered that her left hand still held the two blond braids. She laughed
		unexpectedly--had to shut her mouth hard to keep from emitting an absolute
		peal. She was passing Warren's house now, and on the impulse she set down
		her baggage, and swinging the braids like pieces of rope flung them at the
		wooden porch, where they landed with a slight thud. She laughed again, no
		longer restraining herself. "Huh!" she giggled wildly. "Scalp the selfish thing!"
		Then picking up her suitcase she set off at a half-run down the moonlit street.</p>
