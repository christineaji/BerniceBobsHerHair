	<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey</b></span>Why?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>Because I'm considering it. It's such a sure and easy
way of attracting attention. I want to be a society vampire, you see.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span>So I've decided, that early next week I'm going down
to the Sevier Hotel barber-shop, sit in the first chair, and get my hair
bobbed. Of course I'm charging admission, but if you'll all come down
and encourage me I'll issue passes for the inside seats.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>G. Reece Stoddard </b></span>Iâ€™ll take a box right now. Do you believe in bobbed hair?</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span><b>Bernice Harvey </b></span> I think it's unmoral, but, of course, you've either got to
amuse people or feed 'em or shock 'em.</p>

		Two hours later, while Warren McIntyre was standing passively in the stag line
abstractedly watching the dancers and wondering whither and with whom
Marjorie had disappeared, an unrelated perception began to creep slowly
upon him--a perception that Bernice, cousin to Marjorie, had been cut in on
several times in the past five minutes. He closed his eyes, opened them and
looked again. Several minutes back she had been dancing with a visiting boy, a
matter easily accounted for; a visiting boy would know no better. But now she
was dancing with some one else, and there was Charley Paulson headed for
her with enthusiastic determination in his eye. Funny--Charley seldom danced
with more than three girls an evening.
Warren was distinctly surprised when--the exchange having been effected--the
man relieved proved to be none other than G. Reece Stoddard himself. And G.
Reece seemed not at all jubilant at being relieved. Next time Bernice danced
near, Warren regarded her intently. Yes, she was pretty, distinctly pretty; and tonight
her face seemed really vivacious. She had that look that no woman,
however histrionically proficient, can successfully counterfeit--she looked as if
she were having a good time. He liked the way she had her hair arranged,
wondered if it was brilliantine that made it glisten so. And that dress was
becoming--a dark red that set off her shadowy eyes and high coloring. He
remembered that he had thought her pretty when she first came to town, before
he had realized that she was dull. Too bad she was dull--dull girls unbearable--
certainly pretty though.
His thoughts zigzagged back to Marjorie. This disappearance would be like
other disappearances. When she reappeared he would demand where she had
been--would be told emphatically that it was none of his business. What a pity
she was so sure of him! She basked in the knowledge that no other girl in town
interested him; she defied him to fall in love with Genevieve or Roberta. Warren
sighed. The way to Marjorie's affections was a labyrinth indeed. He looked up.
Bernice was again dancing with the visiting boy. Half unconsciously he took a
step out from the stag line in her direction, and hesitated. Then he said to
himself that it was charity. He walked toward her --collided suddenly with G.
Reece Stoddard.

		That night at one o'clock Marjorie, with one hand on the electric-light switch in
the hall, turned to take a last look at Bernice's sparkling eyes.
